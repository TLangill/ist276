			<h2>HTML</h2>
			<img src="TestOne\images\htmllogo.jpg"></img>
			<p>HTML is the basic building block of the internet. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. A web browser recieves HTML pages, inteprets each HTML tag (title, h1, p) and creates a webpage for the viewer. Every webpage is made in HTML. Usually, CSS is used to improve the look of HTML and JavaScript is used to improve the functionality of HTML. </p>

					<h3>Flash vs. HTML5 and the future of browser gaming</h3>
					<blockquote>"For much of its history, Flash was an integral part of the web’s ecosystem. Aside from using Java Applets (discontinued long ago), playing games in the browser simply wasn’t possible without Flash. Now that era is over, and websites must quickly adapt or be left behind."</blockquote>

					<h3>Stop using so many divs! An intro to semantic HTML </h3>
					<blockquote>"One of the primary advancements of HTML5 was introducing a standardized set of semantic elements. The term "semantic" refers to the meaning of a word or a thing, so "semantic elements" are elements designed to mark up the structure of a document in a more meaningful way, a way that makes it clear what they're for, what purpose they serve in the document. And importantly, since they're standardized, these elements define the document in a way that everyone can use and understand, robots included."</blockquote>

			<h2>CSS</h2>
			<img src="TestOne\images\csslogo.jpg"></img>
			<p>CSS is a way of making a webpage look nicer by specifically designating visual effects to each HTML element. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is made up of simple statements that are tied to each block element, such as font-family, text-color, and text-align.</p>

			<h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
			<img src="TestOne\images\jslogo.jpg"></img>
			<p>JavaScript is similar to CSS in that it adds flavor to websites. Unlike CSS, it doesn't add visual effects like text size or text color. Rather, it allows for functionality in webpages, such as buttons instead of hyperlinks. It allows for people to interact with websites. Almost all websites use it in some form.</p>

SQL is the second most in-demand IT skill for the second year in a row."</blockquote>
