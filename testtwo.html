			<h1>A Ordering Website for Cool Beans Coffee Roasters</h1>
			<p>This website will be created as a testing site to try and create a in-browser ordering system for Cool Beans Coffee Roasters.
			It will include a price list, a product list, as well as a way to submit an order directly from the webpage. Ideally, the webpage would feature 
			feature a way for the visitor to select several items and send them to a company email address, where a wholesale order will be generated. 
			</p>
			</div>
			
			<div>
			<h1>The Rationale</h1>
			<p> I have a love for coffee and business. My dad's coffeeshop is a place I really enjoy working at and is a place I want to help thrive
			A few weeks ago I was poking around their website and noticed that ordering wholesale orders required you to email a separate email address 
			yourself. Streamlining the process could make the potential customer remain engaged. </p>
			</div>
			
			<div>
		<h1>Target Audience</h1>
		<p>The target audience is twofold. I believe that one audience is the visitors who would see this page, but the more important audience is the 
		owners, my parents. I would have to do a good job to try and convince them to use this code for their webpage. </p>
			</div>
		
		<div>
		<h1>JavaScript Opportunities</h1>
		<p>I believe that there are opportunities to use JavaScript in this project, especially regarding inputting orders (maybe on a checklist), a text box to add the address, and the way that all this information is transmitted to the company.
		</p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
		<h1>The Team</h1>
		<p>It'll be me for this one. This project will be solo.<p>
		</div>
		
		<div>
		<h1>Using GitHub</h1>
		<p>GitHub will be useful for backing up my files so that I can work on different computers. It also makes it easier to copy onto Webclass. I won't need it to coordinate with teammates, but it allows for me to have a staging ground for the project. 
		</p></div>
